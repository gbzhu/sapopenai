original idea: I think in order to solve the problem of short range of electric cars, we should strengthen 3 aspects, 1. increase the battery capacity of the car, so that the car can run farther 2. build more charging stations, so that the charging becomes more convenient 3. develop new materials and new technologies to improve the charging efficiency, which can shorten the charging time
